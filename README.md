# data_patterns

A little repo to collect useful, general data analysis/cleaning patterns. I constantly find myself looking through old scripts, going "man I know I did something similar in this project", but it would be great to generalize them and put them here to find.

Each script is a single generalized analysis case, and any time actual data are required (built-in data like `mtcars` and `iris` are preferred), they go in the data folder.

No need to be too strict about "generalized" use case- if something seems useful, but changing it to be a generalized example is gonna be a lot of work, just toss it up here. However, **do use comments, lots and lots of comments.**

At some point, I'll organize the scripts into folders based on general type.
